        <p class="headteacher-message">
            I warmly welcome you to Bright Junior School. Bright Junior School started in 2004 basically to act as a centre for quality but affordable education. Owing to its belief that; "Knowledge is an asset", coupled with its relaxed, cool, secure, and learner-friendly environment, the school has become a home away from the real learners' home. A lot of attention is paid to meaningful and practical classroom instruction, co-curricular activities, effective children's welfare, timely involvement of all stakeholders focusing on the development of a "whole person".
